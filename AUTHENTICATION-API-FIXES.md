# Authentication and API Endpoint Fixes

## Issues Fixed

In this update, we've addressed several critical issues in the Airbnb for camping application:

### 1. Auth User ID Type Mismatch

- **Problem**: Supabase Auth was providing UUIDs as user IDs, but our database expected integers for the user_id field.
- **Fix**: Modified all endpoints to look up users by auth_user_id (the Supabase UUID) instead of trying to convert UUIDs to integers.
- **Files Changed**: 
  - `src/middleware/auth.js`: Updated to use auth_user_id
  - `src/routes/users.js`: Fixed /me endpoint to look up users by auth_user_id
  - `src/routes/dashboard.js`: Enhanced user lookups to try multiple fields (email, auth_user_id, user_id)

### 2. Reviews Stats Endpoint Unauthorized Access

- **Problem**: The `/api/reviews/stats/:id` endpoint was returning 401 errors even though it should be a public endpoint.
- **Fix**: Moved the reviews stats endpoint to be defined BEFORE the authentication middleware to make it truly public.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/routes/reviews.js`: Relocated stats endpoint before authentication middleware is applied

### 3. Checkout Session Creation Failures

- **Problem**: The `/api/checkout/create-session` was failing with "Missing required fields" errors.
- **Fix**: Fixed field mappings to correctly transform frontend data (spotId, startDate, endDate, totalAmount) to match backend field names (camper_id, start_date, end_date, total).
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/app.js`: Fixed parameter mapping and data transformation in checkout endpoint
  - `src/services/payment.service.js`: Enhanced data validation and error handling

### 4. Authentication Middleware Import Missing

- **Problem**: The app.js file was using the authenticate middleware but it wasn't imported, causing "authenticate is not defined" errors.
- **Fix**: Added the import for the authenticate middleware from the auth.js file.
- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/app.js`: Added import for authenticate middleware

## How to Verify Fixes

After deployment, the following endpoints should now work correctly:

1. `/api/users/me` - Should return user data for authenticated users
2. `/api/reviews/stats/:id` - Should return review statistics without auth errors
3. `/api/checkout/create-session` - Should properly accept booking data and create Stripe checkout sessions

## Remaining Issues

Some issues that might still need attention:

1. Ensure session storage and cookie handling is consistent between environments
2. Verify all endpoints properly validate authentication tokens
3. Add proper error handling for auth token expiration/refresh

## Deployment

Use the `scripts/comprehensive-fix.ps1` script to deploy all these fixes at once:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\kkaro\OneDrive - Thomas More\SecondYear2nd\Web Programming\airbnb_for_camping\airbnb_backend"
.\scripts\comprehensive-fix.ps1
```

Alternatively, to deploy specific fixes:

```powershell
# For authentication middleware import fix
.\scripts\deploy-auth-fix.ps1

# For checkout field mapping and review stats fixes
.\scripts\deploy-checkout-reviews-fix.ps1
```

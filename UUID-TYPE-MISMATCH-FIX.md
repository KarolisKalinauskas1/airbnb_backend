# UUID Type Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing 500 Internal Server Errors, particularly with the `/api/users/me` endpoint during login. The root cause was a type mismatch between:

- **Supabase Auth**: Provides UUIDs as user identifiers (e.g., `0ed93b65-0e03-48dd-b859-18539597efe5`)
- **Prisma Schema**: Expects integers for the `user_id` field in the `public_users` table

This caused failures when the application tried to parse a UUID string as an integer.

## Solution
We implemented the following changes to fix this issue:

1. **Updated User Routes**:
   - Modified the `/api/users/me` endpoint to search by `auth_user_id` (the UUID from Supabase) instead of trying to convert it to an integer
   - Added fallback to search by email if the user isn't found by auth_user_id
   - Improved error handling with clear error messages

2. **Enhanced Auth Middleware**:
   - Updated authentication middleware to look for users by both `auth_user_id` and email
   - Added automatic updating of missing `auth_user_id` values when a user is found by email
   - Improved public endpoint access for better resilience

3. **Database Repair**:
   - Created `fix-auth-user-id.js` script to update all users with correct Supabase UUIDs
   - This ensures existing users have the proper mapping between Supabase auth and database records

## Deployment
A deployment script `fix-uuid-deploy.ps1` is provided to:
1. Commit the code changes
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Run the database fix script

## Implementation Details
The key to this fix is using the `auth_user_id` field in the `public_users` table to store the Supabase UUID, while keeping the auto-incrementing integer `user_id` as the primary key for internal references.

## Testing
After deployment, verify that:
1. Users can log in successfully
2. The `/api/users/me` endpoint returns correct user data
3. Authentication flows work properly throughout the application
